Activation of PI3K / AKT / mTOR signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of many cancer types including breast cancer . Activated PI3K / AKT signaling is also associated with Cowden 's syndrome that is caused by germline phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) mutations . PTEN expression is also decreased in many sporadic breast cancers . Breast cancers with increased levels of AKT phosphorylation / activation and cancers exhibiting a gene expression signature of PTEN loss show poor disease outcome [ 1 ] . Loss of PTEN activity and activation of PI3 K signaling are associated with resistance to endocrine therapy [ 2 ] and trastuzumab [ 3,4 ] . Most PTEN - low tumors and many of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PIK3CA ) mutant tumors activate AKT for oncogenic signaling . Thus , the PI3K / AKT pathway is a promising target for breast cancer therapy ."

The modified Z - score proposed by Iglewicz and Hoaglin [ 11 ] was calculated based on the median of expression and absolute deviation about the median . We defined the patient 's composite PI3 K pathway activity score as the sum of the modified Z - scores of phospho - protein of pAKT , 4E - BP1 , S6 K , and S6 ( i.e. , PI3 K score = pS6 S240/244 + pS6 S235/236 + pS6 K T389 + p4E - BP1 S65 + p4E - BP1 T37/46 + p - mTOR S2448 + pPRAS40 T246 + pAKT S473 + pAKT T308 ) .

In stage I of the study , we observed a confirmed partial response in a patient with a breast cancer bearing a PIK3CA mutation . By our adaptive design , one objective response fulfilled stage I criteria for response , thus both PIK3CA / AKT and PTEN loss / mutation cohorts proceeded to accrue . If there were no further responses seen , based on the initial statistical plan , we would be expected to treat 20 evaluable patients on the PIK3CA/ AKT arm and 12 patients on the PTEN loss arm before clinical futility would be declared and trial terminated . However , after 27 patients were enrolled in the study , no additional objective responses were seen , and the median PFS was 8 weeks . Therefore , the clinical team , after consulting with the trial statistician , made a decision to stop accrual due to a lack of clinical benefit . Figure 1 shows the swimmer plots for 27 patients .

This may , in part , be due to inadequate target inhibition at tolerable doses in heavily pre - treated patients with pathway activation , as well as tumor heterogeneity and evolution in markers such as PTEN conferring challenges in patient selection . The lack of statistically significant pathway inhibition in the tumors was an interesting finding that needs further study , and raises awareness that circulating biomarkers may not adequately reflect target inhibition in tumor tissue . The fact that one of the patients with a PR had an activating KRAS mutation , also confirmed on pre - treatment biopsy , is unexpected , and suggests that the simplistic view that MAPK co - mutations would confer resistance to AKT inhibitors may not be sufficient for precision oncology , and better modeling of driver mutations , pathway activation , and adaptive responses is needed .",

The optimal duration of lenalidomide maintenance is a matter of debate . In Cancer and Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) [ 3 ] and Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome ( IFM ) [ 2 ] trials , patients received post - ASCT placebo or continuous lenalidomide 10 mg for 3 months escalated then to 15 mg , until disease progression , intolerable side effects , or death . The IFM group decided to stop the treatment in the lenalidomide arm due to the noticed risk of secondary primary malignancies ( SPMs ) in opposite to the CALGB trial where patients continued maintenance until progression . Based on the meta - analysis , the risk of death due to SPM was similar between lenalidomide and placebo or observation groups but there was a 34 % reduction in risk to die of multiple myeloma ( MM ) in lenalidomide maintenance arm [ 5 ] ."

In RCC , the immune checkpoint protein programmed death-1 ( PD-1 ) and its ligand ( PD - L1 ) are widely expressed on immune cells that infiltrate the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells , respectively [ 10][11][12 ] . Moreover , increased PD-1 / L1 expression in RCC is associated with aggressive pathological features and a worse prognosis [ 10][11][12 ] . In patients with mRCC , anti - PD-1 and anti - PD - L1 antibodies have shown promising responses and improved overall survival ( OS ) , both as monotherapy and in combination with other classes of agents . Nivolumab ( anti - PD-1 ) was the first agent in this class to be approved by regulatory authorities , based on findings from the randomized phase III CheckMate 025 trial , which compared nivolumab monotherapy with everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who had received prior antiangiogenic therapy [ 13 ] . More recently , nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab ( anti - cytotoxic T - lymphocyte protein 4 ) was approved for patients with previously untreated , intermediate - or poor - risk , advanced RCC , based on OS data from the phase III CheckMate 214 trial of nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared with sunitinib [ 14 ] ."

LMP1 and LMP2 in particular behave like B cell receptor ( BCR)mediated Akt , which is dependent upon spleen tyrosine kinase and Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) . These tyrosine kinases contribute to enhanced cellular proliferation and survival signaling such as the nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - \u03baB ) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K / Akt ) pathways [ 6 ] . In our experiment , we transfected vector - encoding LMP1 or LMP1_delCTAR1(C - terminal - activating region 1 ) and LMP1_delCTAR2 into a DLBCL cell line and observed the BCR signaling pathway ( Supplementary Materials and methods ) . As a result , the BTK signaling pathway was activated when LMP1 was expressed . It was also confirmed that the CTAR1 of LMP1 was an important domain for BTK activation . In addition , cell viability was decreased when the BTK inhibitor ( ibrutinib ) was treated with LMP1-expressing cells ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Based on previous studies that proved the efficacy of rituximab - cyclophosphamidedoxorubicin hydrochloride - vincristine sulfate - prednisone ( RCHOP ) therapy combined with ibrutinib ( I - RCHOP ) , we designed this study to boost the anti - tumor effect of EBVpositive DLBCL [ 7,8 ] .

Patients often present with advanced disease with worldwide 5-year survival rates of 9 % , reducing to 3 % for metastatic pancreatic cancer [ 2 ] . Median progression - free survival ( PFS ) with standard - of - care first - line treatments is around 6 months and disease progression can result in deterioration in health - related quality of life ( HRQoL ) [ 3,4 ] . As a consequence , patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer have reduced HRQoL due to high emotional burden , symptom burden ( in particular pain , fatigue , vomiting and diarrhoea ) , and poor prognosis [ 5][6][7][8][9][10 ] . When evaluating the best treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer , it is important to not only assess survival , which is relatively short , but also ensure that there are no detrimental effects of treatment on HRQoL. Indeed , American Society for Clinical Oncology guidelines on treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer recommend that clinicians should proactively discuss quality of life issues such as pain , fatigue , and loss of appetite , which tend to be overlooked yet have significant impact on daily life , with their patients [ 11 ] ."

The aim of maintenance treatment is to prolong PFS , and ultimately overall survival , delaying the need for subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy . In addition , maintenance treatment should seek to preserve HRQoL , which may be improved following effective first - line chemotherapy [ 13 ] . First - line treatment with FOLFIRINOX has been shown to improve overall HRQoL and lead to a decrease in some symptoms , including pain , for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer [ 13 ] . A prespecified secondary objective of the POLO trial was to evaluate the effect of olaparib on HRQoL , specifically the adjusted mean change from baseline in Global Health Status ( GHS ) score using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-item module ( EORTC QLQ - C30 ) ."

Furthermore , mutations in RAS or BRAF have been suggested as predictive biomarkers for MEK inhibition . 8,9 In previous clinical trials , selumetinib , an inhibitor of MEK1/ 2 , demonstrated interesting activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with metastatic BTC . 10,11 Similarly , binimetinib is a potent , adenosine triphosphate - uncompetitive , highly selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/2 with on - target activity that has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo . 12 Moreover , phase I study of binimetinib showed a manageable safety profile , target inhibition and dose - proportional exposure . 13 In this study , we evaluated the preclinical synergistic activity of binimetinib and fluoropyrimidine against BTC cell lines . Supported by the preclinical results , we then conducted a phase Ib study of binimetinib and capecitabine in gemcitabinepretreated BTC patients to assess the safety and early antitumor activity .

In normal homeostasis , Ang2 levels are low , but the Ang2 / Ang1 ratio is increased in inflamed tissues , e.g. in sepsis and in malignancies , including breast cancer [ 12,13 ] . High Ang2 levels are associated with poor patient survival in multiple malignancies , breast cancer among others [ 14][15][16][17][18][19 ] . Some of the Ang / Tie system targeted antibodies have already been evaluated in clinical trials , but so far , the effects of anti - Ang2 monotherapy have been modest [ 20][21][22 ] . A better understanding of Ang function is clearly needed for the rational development of effective Ang - pathway targeted therapies . Although Tie1 expression in endothelial cells is increased in tumor vessels and deletion of the Tie1 gene in tumor - bearing mice decreased tumor growth and angiogenesis in preclinical experiments [ 4,23 ] , the significance of Tie1 in tumor progression is also unclear . Tie1 ectodomain cleavage occurs in vivo in association with acute [ 11 ] and chronic inflammation [ 24 ] , leading to increased concentration of the soluble extracellular domain in the serum of patients with severe viral infections [ 11 ] . Furthermore , Tie1 deletion in a murine metastasis model tightened endothelial barrier and therefore , reduced metastatic foci [ 25 ] ."

The primary analysis ( median follow - up of 18.4 months ) demonstrated an 84 % reduction in the risk of disease progression ( PD ) or death ( as assessed by an independent review committee ) and significant improvement in OS for ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil , supporting the initial approval of first - line ibrutinib for CLL / SLL in the United States and for CLL in the European Union , with ibrutinib now approved for CLL in over 90 countries [ 8][9][10 ] . Data previously reported from this study after a median follow - up of 28.5 months demonstrated a sustained PFS benefit for ibrutinib and improved depth of response over time , with no new unexpected safety concerns [ 11 ] .

In 1996 , McGuire and colleagues conducted a clinical trial to set up the standard therapy for patients with ETOC , including primary debulking surgery ( PDS ) , also called primary cytoreductive surgery ( PCS ) plus adjuvant triweekly paclitaxel and cisplatin therapy [ 19 ] . The following studies have confirmed the superiority of survival benefits using paclitaxel into cisplatin - based regimens in place of cyclophosphamide for the treatment of patients with ETOC and PPSC [ 20,21 ] .

In addition , dose - dense chemotherapy can not only preserve the immune system but also promote the treatment - mediated tumor - specific immunity , especially the antitumor kill cluster of differentiation 8 + ( CD8 + ) T - cell response [ 103 ] . Therefore , hematological markers have been evaluated to try to establish their predictive value [ 104][105][106][107 ] . Dose intensity strategies include increasing the dose per cycle , decreasing the cycle interval ( dose densification ) and decreasing the interval plus increasing the dose [ 108 ] . However , the latter two strategies involved shortening the gap between chemotherapy , which has proven decisive in some neoplasms such as breast cancer [ 99 ] , and , of most importance , this more frequent administration of cytotoxic agents within short intervals has also decreased the chemotherapy - related death associated with the use of massive doses , such as infection or sepsis caused by severe neutropenia or spontaneous hemorrhage caused by severe thrombocytopenia [ 49 ] ."

In the next year ( 2004 ) , the same author found that increasing the dose of cisplatin above a certain threshold is not recommended in EOC patients because the greater toxicity with higher dose of cisplatin was found [ 110 ] , although some studies did not support a significant increase toxicity after weekly dose - dense cisplatin treatment ( median dose intensity with 32 or 45 mg / m 2 /week ) [ 108 ] . However , the therapeutic effect of dose - dense platinum is still controversial . Some are in favor [ 111,112 ] , but many are against the resultant benefits of dose - dense platinum [ 108,[113][114][115][116 ] . Biweekly dose - dense carboplatin ( AUC5 ) combined with paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m 2 ) is not feasible based on dose - limiting toxicity , even though GCSF was used for support [ 116 ] . Previous studies that the main determinant of dose - dense treatment response was not achieved by the relative dose intensity of platinum itself [ 108 ] .

In the management of all chemosensitive epithelial cancers , combination chemotherapy treatment has provided significant survival benefits compared to single agent chemotherapy when applied as initial therapy , and there is no doubt that the treatment of ETOC is similar in this regard [ 121 ] . Studies showed that combination of taxane and platinum compound appears both to attenuate the toxicity of the platinum compound and to facilitate the delivery of full dose on schedule and this full dose on schedule showed the strong correlation with patient outcomes [ 110 ] . Since both platinum and paclitaxel are the essential cytotoxic agents in ETOC patients after PCS , either any one or both can be administered as dose - dense protocol . Furthermore , dose - dense can be classified according to the types , including semiweekly dose - dense , in which paclitaxel was given weekly and carboplatin was given triweekly , and weekly dose dense , in which both paclitaxel and carboplatin were given weekly [ 47 ] . An accumulation dose of paclitaxel is 240 - 270 mg / m 2 with separating into 80 - 90 mg / m 2 per week compared to a single use of 175 - 180 mg / m 2 every three weeks .

The median OS was 58.5 months in the paclitaxel - cisplatin group and 55.0 months in the paclitaxel - carboplatin group . Although neither PFS nor OS reached the statistically significant difference , it seemed to be little better in patients treated with the paclitaxel - cisplatin regimen compared to those treated with the paclitaxel - carboplatin regimen . However , to compare the frequency and severity of AEs , we found that patients in the paclitaxel - carboplatin group had more AEs than those in paclitaxel - cisplatin group did , including a higher risk of neutropenia and grade 3/4 neutropenia , and the need for a longer period to complete the front - line chemotherapy . The need for a longer period to finish the dose - dense therapy seemed to be associated with a worse outcome for patients . Further analysis showed that the period between the first - time chemotherapy to the last dose ( 6 cycles ) of chemotherapy > 21 weeks was associated with worse prognosis in patients compared to that \u226421 weeks , with hazard ratio ( HR ) of 81.24 for PFS and 9.57 for OS .

Although thrombocytopenia unlikely occurs in chemotherapy - na\u00efve patients , this toxicity usually begins to appear after day 14 and is predictably cumulative , contributing to the consideration of a carboplatin dose reduction [ 140 ] . Due to aforementioned limitation , some gynecological oncologists favored the use of cisplatin as the drug in the platinum - based combination therapy , except for those patients with identified impaired renal function ( eGFR < 60 ml / min ) . The current low - dose cisplatin plus dose - dense paclitaxel regimen was associated with lower rates of hematologic toxicities compared to the conventional dose - dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen . The results from an ICON8 have also shown that patients treated with a weekly regimen had increased grade 3 or 4 toxic effects , although these high - grade toxicities were predominantly uncomplicated [ 33 ] .

We believe that this carboplatin - paclitaxel combination therapy - related hematotoxicity might explain why more patients in the carboplatin - paclitaxel arm had a prolongation of the period between the initial first dose of chemotherapy and the final dose of chemotherapy ( six cycles of chemotherapy ) than those in the cisplatin - paclitaxel arm ( 45 % versus 11.1 % , p = 0.018 ) .

Patients received either 20 \u00d7 2 Gy or 12 \u00d7 2 Gy involved field RT ( IF - RT ) without revealing any difference in the local or systemic control . Despite several critical issues in the study design ( e.g. , heterogeneous histology with 40 % non - follicular grade 1/2 , previous treatments , and non - standardized follow - up examinations ) , 24 Gy was then recommended as a standard dose by the European Society for Medical Oncology [ 2 ] ."

Subsequently , more patients with lowgrade lymphoma received the 2 \u00d7 2 Gy scheme : Table 1 [ 3 - 8 ] shows a summary of different trials using 2 \u00d7 2 Gy LDRT , and CR rates range from 37 % to 82 % . In a subset of patients ( low tumor burden , fewer previous chemotherapies , age of less than 65 years , and treatment with curative intent ) , LDRT showed excellent results ; ORR and CR rate ranged from 93 % to 81 % and from 57 % to 90 % , respectively [ 5,6,8 ] . The mode of action of 2 \u00d7 2 Gy is not completely understood . An induction of the p53 pathway is discussed [ 9,10 ] .

Owing to the superiority of the 24-Gy arm ( freedom from local progression after 2 years : 93.7 % versus 80.4 % ) , recruitment was stopped before the end of the trial was reached [ 7 ] . The CR rates were 40 % after LDRT ( total response rate of 74 % ) and 60 % after 24 Gy ( total response rate of 81 % ) . There were significantly more recurrences ( n = 70 ) in the LDRT arm after a median follow - up time of 26 months as compared with the 24-Gy arm ( 21 recurrences ; hazard ratio 3.42 ; P < 0.0001 ) . However , this trial has several major weaknesses ( e.g. , no limitation or stratification of lymphoma size ; no differentiation between FL grade 1 , 2 , 3a , or 3b ; no central pathological review ; and no standardized follow - up with three - dimensional imaging ) [ 12 ] . In summary , the FORT trial showed some efficacy after LDRT , but in light of the mentioned issues , it is not clear whether the difference between LDRT and 24 Gy was as large as published . In addition , no anti - CD20 antibody was applied and this might result in an increased radiosensitivity of the FL cells [ 13 ] ."
