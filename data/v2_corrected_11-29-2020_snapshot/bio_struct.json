The introduction of checkpoint inhibitors , targeting the cytotoxic T - lymphocyte antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ) and programmed death-1 ( PD-1 ) T - cell receptors , has transformed the treatment landscape for patients with mRCC .

A recently reported melanoma trial comparing I3 + N1 versus I1 + N3 again showed a favourable toxicity profile associated with a lower dose of ipilimumab , with no apparent difference in efficacy at a minimum follow - up of 12 months [ 11 ] . Varying doses and schedules of ipilimumab plus nivolumab have also been examined amongst 8 cohorts within the phase Ib CM012 study in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer , including nivolumab 3 mg / kg q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg / kg given either 6-(n = 39 ) or 12-(n = 38 ) weekly [ 12 ] .

The severity and trajectory of AEs ( symptoms or side - effects ) of both treatment schedules will be reported , allowing comparison between clinician reported AEs ( CTCAE V5.0 ) and patient - reported AEs using PROMs [ 16 ] . The primary outcome measure will be the summary score for HR - QoL of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) QLQ - C30 . Secondary descriptive outcomes will include EQ-5D-5L \u2122 , physical symptoms of RCC ( measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index ( FKSI-19 ) ) and known side - effects of ipilimumab and nivolumab measured by selected items from EORTC Quality of Life Group item bank [ 17 ] . We propose to use the item bank approach to cover expected toxicity of the investigational treatments , as due to the rapid introduction of new targeted cancer treatments there are no existing validated instruments that will cover the full range of AEs and using well developed and validated items from the item bank is a viable rapid alternative .

The study was prompted by the phase 3 JGOG-3016 trial in which weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg / m\u00b2 ) in combination with 3-weekly carboplatin ( area under the curve[AUC]6 ) was found to confer improved progression - free survival and overall survival when compared with standard treatment in Japanese patients with advanced ovarian cancer . 1 As there is increasing evidence of pharma cogenomic distinctions between Asian and white populations , ICON8 was designed to explore whether the survival advantage observed in JGOG-3016 could also be observed in a mostly European population with ovarian cancer . 2,3 Results from ICON8 have shown that weekly , dose - dense paclitaxel - containing chemotherapy conferred no progression - free survival advantage when com pared with standard 3-weekly treatment . 4 As a secondary endpoint of the main study , the effect on health - related quality of life ( referred to as quality of life throughout this Article ) was assessed during treatment and in follow - up .

[ 1 ] Most patients ( > 70 % ) with GC are diagnosed at the advanced stage , [ 2 ] as a consequence , it shows a disappointing result . [ 3,4 ] Accumulating evidence shows that only 5 % of patients with metastatic cancer are still alive 5 years after diagnosis . [ 5 ] In recent years , immune microenvironment has been increasingly valued for its crucial role in the process of GC onset and progression . [ 6][7][8 ] Although surgical resection , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic therapeutic agents , and other measures have been used to improve the therapeutic efficacy of GC , [ 9 ] the prognosis is still dismal . [ 10 ] Thus , it is important to explore new strategies to prolong the survival , improve the quality of life of the advanced GC patients . Fortunately , traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) has its unique advantages in preventing and treating GC [ 11,12 ] and it also has an efficacy in improving immune function .

It is unclear if ponatinib could be beneficial in bevacizumab - na\u00efve patients or in patients whose GBM harbors a FGFR - TACC fusion as neither of these populations were examined in this study .

This pathway is altered in more than 50 % of oestrogen receptorpositive advanced breast cancers , most frequently through somatic hotspot mutation in exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA , encoding the p110\u03b1 isoform of PI3K.

PI3 K pathway alteration is associated with endocrine therapy resistance through ligand inde pendent activation of the oestrogen receptor . 5,6 Conversely , preclinical data show compensatory increases in liganddependent oestrogen receptor transcription following PI3 K pathway inhibition .

To achieve this goal , we analyzed data from a curated EHR - derived real - world dataset to compare outcomes in a cohort of women with hormone - receptor positive ( HR+ ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ( HER2- ) metastatic breast cancer ( mBC ) who received first - line letrozole therapy in a real - world setting with those in the control arm of the phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial . [ 13 ] An inverse probability of treatment weighting ( IPTW ) approach was used to account for potential baseline differences in the real - world and PALOMA-2 cohorts , which allowed retrospective evaluation of the comparability of the realworld and traditional RECIST - based clinical trial endpoints in 2 similar cohorts .

Despite the increased toxicity in the DD - EPIC group , most toxicities were acceptable , and the completion rate was much higher than that in GOG172 , with the infection rate 11.6 % in AICE vs. 16 % in GOG172 , and a completion rate of IP chemotherapy 90.6 % vs. 42 % , respectively . 2,5 The mean inpatient cost in the DD - EPIC group was not much higher than that in the control group ( $ 9338.2 vs. $ 7424.4 ) ."

Constitutive activation of either of these TKs plays a central role in the oncogenic behavior of GIST [ 6,7 ] . The early characterization of GIST mutational status is important in both the localized and metastatic settings to identify mutations which are primarily resistant to imatinib ( such as PDGFRA D842V ) , or exon 9 mutation which requires a higher dose of imatinib in the advanced setting [ 8,9 ] . Patients with GIST lacking KIT or PDGFRA mutations typically do not experience objective responses to imatinib . However , other mutations may be present in these tumors , with the largest group represented by succinate dehydrogenase - deficient GIST by immunochemistry , which may reflect underlying alterations in an succinate dehydrogenase subunit , and may be associated with familial heritable syndromes ( Carney triad or Carney - Stratakis syndrome ) [ 10][11][12][13][14 ] . Other subtypes of GIST lacking activating mutations in KIT or PDGFRA may have mutations in NF1 ( usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 ) or in BRAF or KRAS [ 15][16][17 ] .

Secondary resistance mutations usually arise in the catalytic domain of the kinase : at the switch pocket , which typically occur in KIT exons 13 and 14 or PDGFRA exons 14 and 15 and sterically disrupt drug binding or conformationally activate KIT and in the activation loop switch encoded by KIT exons 17 and 18 and PDGFRA exon 18 [ 29,44,45 ] .

This profile is achieved through a unique dual mechanism of action that secures the kinase into an inactive conformation or off state , resulting in the inhibition of downstream signaling . Ripretinib acts as a structural surrogate for the inhibitory switch by binding to the switch pocket . This prevents access to the switch pocket by the activation loop , thereby locking the kinase into the inactive state .

Low AR activity has been linked to stemness and lineage plasticity , or change in differentiation state , that are now recognized as a common cause of acquired resistance to AR - targeting therapies ( 21)(22)(23)(24)(25 ) . Importantly , all of the baseline tumors from our study were adenocarcinomas , and most prostate adenocarcinoma tumors express a luminal lineage program ( 22 ) . However , a basal lineage , neurogenic / stemness program is present in a subset of patients and is linked with prostate cancer aggressiveness ( 26,27 ) . Indeed , prior work demonstrated that localized prostate tumors with a basal lineage program are much less likely to respond to ADT vs. patients whose tumors harbor a luminal lineage program ( 22 ) . Therefore , we next sought to measure signatures of these lineages ( 26 ) and determine if they were differentially activated between nonresponders and responders . Our analysis demonstrates that a basal lineage , neurogenic / stemness program is activated in nonresponders to enzalutamide treatment , while a luminal lineage program is more activated in responders ( Fig . 5C ) , corroborating the prior work in prostate cancer examining the effect of basal lineage on promoting resistance to ADT ( 22 ) ."

During that time , the Intermediate Clinical Endpoints in Cancer of the Prostate surrogacy work showed that measures based on metastatic progression could be used as a surrogate for survival in patients presenting with M0 disease , allowing trials in that setting to achieve increased power sooner [ 2 ] . Given the prognosis for metastatic and non - metastatic patients is now very different and that other trials of first - line docetaxel have kept metastatic and non - metastatic patients separate , the STAMPEDE team agreed that the long - term follow - up results would be analysed separately for these two groups of patients ."

However there is still controversy about patient stratification and selection for treatment . Metastatic burden sub - group analyses of the CHAARTED and GETUG-15 trials have led some to conclude that docetaxel should not be given as a first - line treatment of patients presenting with ' low metastatic burden ' disease [ 3,[9][10][11 ] . This represents $ 40 % of patients presenting with de novo mHNPC [ 12,13 ] . These were retrospective analyses of relatively small subgroups of these trials and a number of groups have not been persuaded by these exploratory retrospective analyses . Reflecting this uncertainty , major treatment guidelines offer conflicting advice about whether all metastatic patients should receive combination treatment or whether this should be restricted only to those with ' high - burden ' , as specified in the CHAARTED trial [ 11,[14][15][16 ] ."

A comparison of toxicity reported across groups in the first year of follow - up shows higher toxicity in docetaxel ( 42 % docetaxel reported G3 - 5 toxicity versus 24 % in Control ) . However , toxicity reports for subsequent follow - up , after the initial year , are balanced across groups ( 27 % docetaxel reported G3 - 5 toxicity compared with 28 % control ) , with no good evidence of increased toxicity in the docetaxel group after the first year of follow - up . Table 5 shows some evidence that control patients were more likely to report starting second - line ( or subsequent ) treatment following disease progression , with 80 % reporting starting at least one further line of treatment compared with 68 % for Docetaxel . The types of further therapy reported are broadly similar between the two groups .",

Patients were stratified on the basis of sex ( male v female ) , stage of disease ( IIIB v IV M1a v IV M1b v recurrent disease ) , smoking history ( never - v ever - smoker ) , and best response at random assignment ( complete or partial v stable disease ) . Cox proportional hazards models , stratified according to these factors , were used to estimate hazard ratios ( HRs ) to test for significance of the timing of events and to fit multivariable models .

The earlier phase IIa JOSHUA trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier , NCT01461057 ) had demonstrated that a pertuzumab dose of 840 mg every 3 weeks led to higher serum trough concentrations versus the currently approved dose for use in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer ( 840 mg loading dose/420 mg maintenance dose ) , thus allowing patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer to achieve pertuzumab serum trough concentrations similar to those observed in patients with HER2positive metastatic breast cancer , with a safety profile similar to the 840 mg loading dose/420 mg maintenance dose regimen [ 9,10 ] .

For example , the ToGA trial demonstrated longer OS in patients from Japan compared with the overall population [ 13 ] . In addition , the phase III AVAGAST study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier , NCT00548548 ) of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer reported longer OS in the control arm ( placebo plus chemotherapy ) and lowered improvement of OS in the bevacizumab arm in patients from Asia compared with those from Eastern Europe / South America and the USA/ Western Europe [ 14,15 ] . These differences in survival outcomes may be due to differences in patient baseline characteristics , healthcare , and post - progression treatment across the different regions [ 14 ] , and highlight the importance of subgroup analyses according to regions .

Therefore , therapies that stimulate the immune system can benefit patients , both early in their disease course and after relapse ( Kumar & Anderson , 2016;Guillerey et al , 2016 ) . Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that exerts potent direct tumoricidal and immune - stimulating effects through binding to its target cereblon , a protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex , and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos ( Lopez - Girona et al , 2012;Bjorklund et al , 2015 ) . Compared with lenalidomide , pomalidomide has increased potency against cereblon , different substrate degradation kinetics , and a distinct gene activation profile , and thus , pomalidomide has antitumor and immune stimulating properties distinct from those of lenalidomide ( Lopez - Girona et al , 2012;Bjorklund et al , 2015;Ocio et al , 2015;Sehgal et al , 2015 ) .

Plitidepsin effects are related to the induction of early oxidative stress , which induces the sustained activation of c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) and p38MAPK and finally apoptosis [ 3,4 ] . The eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 ( eEF1A2 ) , a protein which is overexpressed in MM , has been identified as the primary target for plitidepsin [ 5 ] . In vitro studies showed antiproliferative activity against several human MM cell lines [ 6,7 ] . In vivo studies showed an antitumour effect of plitidepsin in xenograft MM models as a single agent or in combination with dexamethasone ( DXM ) [ 6 ] . Plitidepsin plus DXM showed activity in a phase II clinical trial conducted in relapsed / refractory MM patients [ 8 ] . Based on the data from the randomized phase III ADMYRE trial , which compared plitidepsin plus DXM with DXM alone , this plitidepsin combination has been recently approved in Australia for the treatment of patients with relapsed / refractory MM who have received at least three prior treatment regimens , including both a PI and an IMiD. Plitidepsin plus DXM has been also approved for its use after two prior lines of therapy in the case of patients refractory and/or intolerant to both a PI and an IMiD.

It binds covalently to the minor groove of DNA and disrupts transcription regulation , leading to G2-M cell cycle arrest and ultimately apoptosis . 4 Preclinical studies indicate that trabectedin , besides having a potent antiproliferative effect , modifies the tumour microenvironment by reducing the number and function of macrophages in the tumour stroma ( tumour associated macrophages - TAM ) . Since TAM produce several angiogenic factors , their inhibition by trabectedin results in an anti - angiogenic effect that is demonstrated well in preclinical systems . 5,6 Bevacizumab is an antibody that binds and inactivates VEGF , the main factor that hypoxic cancer cells produce to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis . The mechanisms of resistance to bevacizumab are not fully clear yet but it seems likely that the reduced function of VEGF pathways is compensated by overproduction of other angiogenic factors . 3 The combination of compounds that inhibit several angiogenic pathways could , therefore , be advantageous for a prolonged antiangiogenic effect and the combination of trabectedin with bevacizumab inhibit several of these mechanisms at the same time ."

The median platinum - free interval from the previous platinumbased therapy was 8.9 months ( IQR : 7.9 - 10.0 ; range 6.0 - 12.9 ) . At analysis , three patients were still on treatment with BT . Adherence to treatment was satisfactory . Of the 44 patients who had discontinued treatment at the time of analysis , bevacizumab and/ or trabectedin had been discontinued for causes independent of disease progression in 17 ( 39 % ) and of these , 12(27 % ) for toxicity or SAE . The median number of BT cycles was 10 ( IQR : 6 - 16 ; range 2 - 34 ) ; 27/47 ( 57 % ) patients received ten or more cycles of BT . In the PP population ( 46 patients ) , 9 ( 20 % ) had a complete ( CR ) and 24 ( 52 % ) a partial response ( PR ) . Eight ( 17 % ) patients reached stable disease ( SD ) and 5 ( 11 % ) had progressed by the first disease assessment . Efficacy and the main safety results for first and second stages are shown in Table 2 .",

Once a patient with metastatic CRC has experienced progression on first and second - line chemotherapy and biological therapies , the survival benefit of remaining therapies is limited [ 2,3 ] . In addition , therapeutic options may be constrained by patient comorbidities , age , or performance status . Novel therapeutic regimens are needed that are both tolerable and provide meaningful clinical benefit . Ziv - aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein containing portions of the extracellular domains of VEGFR1 ( also known as Flt-1 ) and VEGFR2 ( also known as KDR or Flk-1 ) . Ziv - aflibercept binds vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A , VEGF - B , and placental growth factor ( PlGF ) , thereby inhibiting VEGF - mediated angiogenesis [ 4 ] . Ziv - aflibercept is approved by the United Stated Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) for use in combination with Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , leucovorin , and irinotecan ( FOLFIRI ) for the second line treatment of metastatic CRC [ 5 ] . In the phase III VELOUR trial , the addition of ziv - aflibercept to FOLFIRI in patients with metastatic CRC resulted in a survival of 13.5 months , compared to 12.1 months for FOLFIRI alone ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.82 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.71 - 0.94 ; P < 0.01 ) [ 6 ] ."

In the chemotherapy refractory setting ( 3rd line and beyond ) , capecitabine monotherapy has a median time to progression of 2 months [ 13 ] . Prior studies combining capecitabine with the anti - VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab have shown that the combination is clinically active and tolerable , even among patients with advanced age or comorbidities [ 14,15 ] . Since anti - VEGF therapies are active for patients with metastatic CRC in the first - line [ 16 ] , second - line [ 17,18 ] , and beyond [ 2 ] , we hypothesized that the combination of capecitabine and ziv - aflibercept would be tolerable , and would exceed the PFS of historical controls ."

Technological improvements ( e.g. , stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) ) [ 2,3 ] and advanced treatment planning ( e.g. , intensity modulated RT ( IMRT ) ) [ 4 ] can enhance RT treatment efficacy by dose escalation to offer more effective pain ( and potentially disease ) control without compromising the organ at risk ( OAR ) through toxicity ."

Multicentre recruitment will allow more precise assessment of the intervention , with the aim of demonstrating that implementing RT in this setting is both feasible and safe among the centers . Secondary aims are to assess potential benefits for disease control , including oncological outcomes .

SBRT is a technique of RT allowing delivery of a high equivalent biological dose in a highly conformed manner , with a favorable toxicity profile [ 3 ] , generally in a few fractions ( fx ) . The possibility of using special techniques such as SBRT in the palliative antalgic setting for bone metastases has been investigated in several phase 2 studies , with good results in terms of symptom response [ 12][13][14][15][16][17 ] . In order to better manage the toxicity profile of such hypofractioned regimens ( mainly related to risk of vertebral fracture [ 18 ] ) further studies [ 19,20 ] have suggested the possibility of using a hypofractionated regimen over the entire bone compartment and going to over - dose with a stereotactic regimen only for the macroscopically visible disease from instrumental examinations .

Fractionated schedules are therefore often preferred for patients with better prognosis ( i.e. , > 6 months ) : the most widely adopted and supported by expert consensus is represented by 20Gy delivered in 5 fx of 4 Gy [ 23 ] . Routine use of prognostic scores to characterize life expectancy and define the most appropriate treatment regimen is very rarely applied in everyday clinical practice .

A recent meta - analysis examined outcomes after several different treatments for early - stage lung cancer in patients with ILD [ 10 ] .

In recent years , several researches have suggested that preoperative radiotherapy and preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy may improve the overall survival ( OS ) compared to surgery alone in patients with head and neck cancer [ 4][5][6 ] . The advantages of preoperative radiotherapy or preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer include down - staging , increased resectability rate , etc . Further evidence from several phase 2 studies have shown that preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy provides excellent treatment outcomes by leading to a pathological complete response rate ranging from 35 to 61 % and an increased 5-year OS rate of up to 70 - 81.5 % [ 5][6][7][8 ] ."

In this study , 222 eligible patients were randomly assigned to a preoperative radiotherapy group ( n = 118 ) or a preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ( n = 104 ) . The results revealed that preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy led to a significantly improved distant metastasis - free survival ( DMFS ) compared to preoperative radiotherapy alone . According to the protocol , non - responders ( defined by < 80 % reduction of the primary lesion after preoperative treatment ) , subsequently underwent resection of the primary lesion with or without neck dissection depending on the nodal status .

To aid in the decision - making process , observed Kaplan - Meier ( KM ) estimates with at least 18 months of follow - up [ 28 , 29 ] which became available during the study were consulted . The data indicated a flattening of the OS curve among responders , which could not be adequately captured using parametric survival analysis . Therefore , the OS patterns in patients who respond to treatment were assumed to follow mortality patterns in the US general population [ 30 ] ( assuming an average age at enrollment of 70 years [ 31 ] and that 74 % [ 23 ] of patients were male ) . Use of general population mortality estimates without adjustment would have resulted in higher survival estimates as compared to the observed estimates .

Thus , development of alternative myeloma drugs for the refractory setting in particular is an urgent priority . Repurposing of well - known drugs approved for use in other therapeutic settings can potentially provide a shortcut to the development of new myeloma treatments 4 . The best example of this strategy is the success of thalidomide , which now shapes an entire class of myeloma agents , after originally being developed as a hypnotic agent ."

It has single - agent activity against myeloma in vivo , inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells via multiple pathways , including inhibition of proteasomal degradation and the PI3K / Akt pathway [ 5][6][7 ] and importantly , by inducing endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress . In a phase I trial ( SAKK 65/08 ) 8 we showed that nelfinavir inhibited proteasome activity and significantly upregulated the expression of proteins related to the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PMBC ) . This key modulator of protein production , folding and destruction 9,10 , also determines proteasome inhibitor sensitivity . Combination of nelfinavir with bortezomib further induced the UPR and overcame proteasome inhibitor resistance 8 . A subsequent phase II trial ( SAKK 39/13 ) demonstrated promising clinical activity of a nelfinavir - bortezomib - dexamethasone combination , with an unprecedented overall response rate of 65 % in heavily pretreated , proteasome inhibitor - refractory MM patients 11 . Preclinical data indicate that nelfinavir was able to overcome resistance to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib via modulation of multidrug resistance ( MDR ) efflux pumps such as ABCB1 ( ref . 12 ) . As lenalidomide is a substrate of the same pump family 12 , and via binding to the E3 ligase cereblon , works on the ubiquitin - proteasome system , we postulated that nelfinavir might likewise be able to overcome resistance to immunomodulatory drugs ."

Nonetheless , the 5-year survival rate in mCRC patients remains poor ( Siegel et al . , 2017 ) . The large variability in survival shows that current routine prognostic evaluation of mCRC is insufficient and needs to be improved , for both resectable and nonresectable metastases . The development of reliable prognostic biomarkers is an increasingly pertinent tool in this setting ."

We and others previously reported~90 % concordance of RAS - mutant status in paired plasma and tissue samples , as well as its predictive value in plasma for anti - EGFR therapy response ( Bettegowda et al . , 2014;Grasselli et al . , 2017;Siravegna et al . , 2015 ) . Mutant allele fractions ( MAFs ) are a measure of the percentage of mutant alleles within the totality of alleles in any given sample . MAF estimations of driver genes have shown important clinical implications in various settings . In a retrospective analysis of the CRYSTAL trial ( Van Cutsem et al . , 2011 ) , mCRC patients with tumor RAS MAFs between 0.1 % and < 5 % were more likely to benefit from the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI . Likewise , resistance to anti - EGFR therapies in mCRC with KRAS MAFs < 1 % ( Azuara et al . , 2016;Laurent - Puig et al . , 2015 ) and longer benefit with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy were associated with higher MAFs in EGFR - mutated lung cancer patients ( Ono et al . , 2014;Zhou et al . , 2011 ) ."

Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 . All patients had previously received fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin , and irinotecan . Most of the patients in each group had a history of treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors , including bevacizumab , ramucirumab , or ziv - aflibercept . Approximately half of patients had RAS wild - type tumors , and no patient had MSI - high tumor . BRAF V600E mutation was detected in one patient ( 1.7 % ) in the trifluridine/ tipiracil plus bevacizumab group and in four patients ( 6.1 % ) in the trifluridine / tipiracil monotherapy group . Patients with left - sided primary tumors were dominant in both groups and comprised 81.7 % of the trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab group and 84.8 % of the trifluridine / tipiracil monotherapy group . Median interval from study treatment start to first computed tomography evaluation was 1.8 months in both groups . Median follow - up was 7.1 months in the trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab groups and 7.2 months in the trifluridine / tipiracil monotherapy group . After study treatment discontinuation , 41.7 % of patients in the trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab groups and 48.5 % of patients in the trifluridine/ tipiracil monotherapy group received subsequent antitumor therapy including regorafenib ( 31.7 vs. 39.4 % ) , clinical trial therapy ( 6.7 vs. 4.5 % ) , and cytotoxic chemotherapy ( 3.3 vs. 6.0 % ) .",
