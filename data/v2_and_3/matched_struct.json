The initial approval for avelumab was based on a clinically meaningful and durable overall response rate ( ORR ) at a minimum of 12-month follow - up [ 21 ] . In addition , clinical trial data suggests heterogeneity in patient outcomes similarly to patterns observed with IOs in other indications [ 7][8][9 ] ; 33 % of patients showed durable antitumor response and changing hazards over time for PFS [ 22,23 ] , whilst OS data were immature to observe any plateaus . The requirement for accurate estimation of survival outcomes for avelumab in mMCC is heightened by lack of treatment options in this rare and aggressive cancer [ 24 ] and highly encouraging clinical trial results for avelumab [ 22,23 ] , necessitating timely patient access based on an assessment of long - term survival potential . Until March 2017 , there were no US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-approved treatments for patients with MCC with treatment primarily limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy or investigational therapies associated with short - lived response with a median OS of 10.2 months after first - line treatment and 4.4 months after second - line treatment or later [ 24 ] ."

However , there were very limited OS data available for patients with objective response to extrapolate survival using parametric fits ( i.e. , only 3 out of 27 patients with response died after the landmark point of 89 days , following disease progression ) . As the feasibility of parametric survival analysis is driven by the number of events , the observed data were considered too limited to reliably attempt distribution fitting . To aid in the decision - making process , observed Kaplan - Meier ( KM ) estimates with at least 18 months of follow - up [ 28 , 29 ] which became available during the study were consulted . The data indicated a flattening of the OS curve among responders , which could not be adequately captured using parametric survival analysis . Therefore , the OS patterns in patients who respond to treatment were assumed to follow mortality patterns in the US general population [ 30 ] ( assuming an average age at enrollment of 70 years [ 31 ] and that 74 % [ 23 ] of patients were male ) . Use of general population mortality estimates without adjustment would have resulted in higher survival estimates as compared to the observed estimates .

The TTP and PFS curves converged after approximately 4 months and the risk of progression declined with eventual plateau of the curves , which implies that approximately 11 % of patients do not progress .

Therefore , therapies that stimulate the immune system can benefit patients , both early in their disease course and after relapse ( Kumar & Anderson , 2016;Guillerey et al , 2016 ) . Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that exerts potent direct tumoricidal and immune - stimulating effects through binding to its target cereblon , a protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex , and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos ( Lopez - Girona et al , 2012;Bjorklund et al , 2015 ) .

With a sample size of 1,495 patients enrolled in the induction phase , it was estimated that 897 patients would be randomly assigned equally to one of the three maintenance therapy groups ( 299 patients per group ) . Patients were stratified on the basis of sex ( male v female ) , stage of disease ( IIIB v IV M1a v IV M1b v recurrent disease ) , smoking history ( never - v ever - smoker ) , and best response at random assignment ( complete or partial v stable disease ) .

Despite the generally favorable toxicity profile of SABR , emerging data indicate that patients with pre - existing ILD are at particularly high risk of toxicity after SABR . A recent meta - analysis examined outcomes after several different treatments for early - stage lung cancer in patients with ILD [ 10 ] . Within the meta - analysis , 13 published studies ( Additional file 1 ) assessed outcomes after SABR . Overall , the use of SABR in patients with earlystage NSCLC and pre - existing ILD was associated with a 25 % risk of radiation pneumonitis ( grade 3 or higher ) and a 15 % risk of treatment - related death . The risk may be highest in the subset of patients with IPF : SABRrelated mortality was 33 % in studies limited to IPF patients , and 14 % in other studies that included only non - IPF fibrotic ILD , or a combination of IPF and non - IPF fibrotic ILD patients ( p = 0.092 ) ."

There is also risk of publication bias favoring the publication studies that show remarkable results ( i.e. high rates of toxicity ) .

Prior to plan approval , the dose to each organ at risk must be verified by the physicist or treating physician . All dose delivery for intensity - modulated plans ( including arc - based treatments ) will be confirmed before treatment by physics staff . Online imaging ( Cone - beam CT , megavoltage CT or orthogonal KV with tumor tracking ) will be used to verify patient positioning for each treatment . Ideally , direct tumour localization should be performed . For gated SABR treatments , direct tumour localization will be performed by matching the tumour position with the region of interest ( ROI ) defined by IGTV_CBCT . This will be followed by a gated 2dimensional ( 2D)-kV in the anterior - posterior plane to verify the gating window . In the absence of direct tumour localization , reliable soft tissue surrogates are recommended .

Endocrine therapies targeting the oestrogen receptor are an integral component of treat ment for oestrogen receptorpositive breast cancer , but resistance develops in almost all patients with advanced disease . Several resistance mechanisms have been identified , including alteration of the PI3K / AKT pathway . This pathway is altered in more than 50 % of oestrogen receptorpositive advanced breast cancers , most frequently through somatic hotspot mutation in exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA , encoding the p110\u03b1 isoform of PI3K. [ 1][2][3][4 ] Less frequently , pathway alteration is induced by loss of function mutation or deletion of the negative regulator PTEN or activating mutations in AKT1 . PI3 K pathway alteration is associated with endocrine therapy resistance through ligand inde pendent activation of the oestrogen receptor . 5,6 Conversely , preclinical data show compensatory increases in liganddependent oestrogen receptor transcription following PI3 K pathway inhibition . [ 7][8][9 ] A rationale therefore exists for simultaneously targeting both the oestrogen receptor and PI3 K pathways ."

MONALEESA-3 and MONALEESA-7 are relatively newer trials that are evaluating ribociclib in advanced HR+ , HER2-breast cancer populations , with treatment lines and combination partners that differ from those explored in MONALEESA-2 [ 13][14][15 ] . Available results from the MONALEESA program have consistently shown that ribociclib is an effective combination partner with a predictable and manageable safety profile , and the ongoing trials and analyses seek to identify optimal combination regimens in different patient types [ 13,14,16 ] .",

Randomisation was done using 1:1 allocation , and was performed after debulking surgery . DD - EPIC was defined to be started at 5 - 10 days after surgery , and no more than 14 days postoperative for those with bowel resection .",

Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ) was evaluated by Pearson 's \u03c7 2 test comparing the expected and observed genotype frequencies of MAML2 SNPs in the control group . Differences in allele and genotype frequencies between glioma patients and cancer - free controls were also tested with \u03c7 2 test . The major allele was considered to be the reference allele . To determine the association between genotypes of MAML2 SNPs and glioma risk , logistic regression analysis was performed to compute odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) , with the adjustment of age and gender .

The reported PFS for patients with HPV - associated OPSCC treated with standard - intensity 70 Gy and cisplatin in RTOG 0129 was 74 % ( 3 year ) and in RTOG 1016 was 78 % ( 5 year ) . 1 PFS was defined as the time from the beginning of treatment to cancer progression or death . Power calculations were based on the null hypothesis that the true 2-year PFS rate was 87 % , with the alternative hypothesis being that the 2-year PFS rate was 0.80 ( or less ) . For a planned total sample size of 90 , the null hypothesis would have been rejected if 18 or more patients had a tumor recurrence or death , with a type 1 error of less than 0.05 . A pathologically positive lymph node that was found on a neck dissection that was performed because of the results of the 3-month post - treatment PET / CT was not classified as a regional failure . This neck dissection was prespecified in the protocol design , outside of the trial is standard of care , and was considered a planned part of the treatment . Kaplan Meier estimates of local control , regional control , local - regional control ( LRC ) , distant metastasis - free survival ( DMFS ) , PFS , causespecific survival , and OS were calculated .",

Plitidepsin effects are related to the induction of early oxidative stress , which induces the sustained activation of c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) and p38MAPK and finally apoptosis [ 3,4 ] . The eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 ( eEF1A2 ) , a protein which is overexpressed in MM , has been identified as the primary target for plitidepsin [ 5 ] . In vitro studies showed antiproliferative activity against several human MM cell lines [ 6,7 ] . In vivo studies showed an antitumour effect of plitidepsin in xenograft MM models as a single agent or in combination with dexamethasone ( DXM ) [ 6 ] . Plitidepsin plus DXM showed activity in a phase II clinical trial conducted in relapsed / refractory MM patients [ 8 ] . Based on the data from the randomized phase III ADMYRE trial , which compared plitidepsin plus DXM with DXM alone , this plitidepsin combination has been recently approved in Australia for the treatment of patients with relapsed / refractory MM who have received at least three prior treatment regimens , including both a PI and an IMiD. Plitidepsin plus DXM has been also approved for its use after two prior lines of therapy in the case of patients refractory and/or intolerant to both a PI and an IMiD. Efficacy and safety results from the ADMYRE trial are presented here .",

It binds covalently to the minor groove of DNA and disrupts transcription regulation , leading to G2-M cell cycle arrest and ultimately apoptosis . 4 Preclinical studies indicate that trabectedin , besides having a potent antiproliferative effect , modifies the tumour microenvironment by reducing the number and function of macrophages in the tumour stroma ( tumour associated macrophages - TAM ) . Since TAM produce several angiogenic factors , their inhibition by trabectedin results in an anti - angiogenic effect that is demonstrated well in preclinical systems . 5,6 Bevacizumab is an antibody that binds and inactivates VEGF , the main factor that hypoxic cancer cells produce to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis . The mechanisms of resistance to bevacizumab are not fully clear yet but it seems likely that the reduced function of VEGF pathways is compensated by overproduction of other angiogenic factors . 3 The combination of compounds that inhibit several angiogenic pathways could , therefore , be advantageous for a prolonged antiangiogenic effect and the combination of trabectedin with bevacizumab inhibit several of these mechanisms at the same time ."

However , in contrast to the notable advances in the treatment of metastatic non - SCC due to genetic alterations , the first - line treatment of SCC has not necessarily been established . Although the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been previously demonstrated , platinum - based cytotoxic therapy is still considered a cornerstone of the treatment of SCC . 1 In clinical practice , the conventional regimens for SCC include a combination of cisplatin or carboplatin with taxanes , gemcitabine , and S-1 based chemotherapy . However , the median overall survival remains approximately 12 - 17 months , regardless of the occurrence of severe adverse events . [ 2][3][4][5][6][7 ] Therefore , a novel combination of anticancer agents leading to fewer severe adverse events is required for the treatment of SCC patients ."

[ 8][9][10 ] A randomized phase III study involving SCC patients showed that overall survival was longer with a combination of nedaplatin and docetaxel than with a combination of cisplatin and docetaxel . 11 Amrubicin is a novel DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor ; our previous phase I / II study revealed that a chemotherapeutic combination of amrubicin and nedaplatin was well tolerated , and that the overall response rate ( ORR ) was 48.6 % ( 17 of 35 cases ) for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer . 12 The subset analysis ( unpublished data ) also suggested that the combination of nedaplatin and amrubicin was more effective in treating SCC ( ORR , 70.0 % ; 7 of 10 cases ) compared to non - SCC ( ORR , 40.0 % ; 10 of 25 cases ) . However , the number of SCC patients in that study was too small to evaluate the efficacy of nedaplatin and amrubicin for SCC . Thus , the present study was designed to clarify the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy with nedaplatin and amrubicin for SCC .",

The mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) inhibitor everolimus has become well - established as an effective therapy for NET arising from the pancreas , lung , or GI tract , with an associated median progression - free survival ( PFS ) of 11.0 months [ 3,4 ] . mTOR kinase is a serine / threonine kinase that serves as a core component of two complexes ; mTORC1 and mTORC2 . The former modulates cell proliferation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 ( 4E - BP1 ) and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 ( S6K1 ) , whereas the latter acts via phosphorylation of AKT [ 5 ] . Everolimus inhibits the mTORC1 complex but may upregulate mTORC2 , which thus maintains AKT activation . Consequently , inhibitors that can target both complexes may offer clinical advantages in terms of improved efficacy [ 5][6][7][8][9][10 ] ."

A Simon optimal two - stage design was used to permit early termination of the study in case of futility . The first stage accrued 15 participants . If at least five or more of the first 15 participants achieved PFS3 , accrual was increased to 12 more participants for a total of 27 participants . The study would have been declared successful if at least 10 or more out of 27 participants achieve PFS at 3 months . This design archives alpha error of 0.10 and beta error of 0.2 .

It is unclear if ponatinib could be beneficial in bevacizumab - na\u00efve patients or in patients whose GBM harbors a FGFR - TACC fusion as neither of these populations were examined in this study . Given ponatinib 's cumulative cardiovascular toxicity , potentially limited penetration across the blood - brain barrier , and the recent drug development of selective brain penetrant FGFR inhibitors , further evaluation of ponatinib in GBMs with FGFR - TACC fusion is not recommended .",

Therefore , the dose of 840 mg of pertuzumab every 3 weeks was selected for investigation in the JACOB trial .",

Some studies have suggested that outcomes for Japanese patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer may differ from those in the global population . For example , the ToGA trial demonstrated longer OS in patients from Japan compared with the overall population [ 13 ] . In addition , the phase III AVAGAST study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier , NCT00548548 ) of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer reported longer OS in the control arm ( placebo plus chemotherapy ) and lowered improvement of OS in the bevacizumab arm in patients from Asia compared with those from Eastern Europe / South America and the USA/ Western Europe [ 14,15 ] . These differences in survival outcomes may be due to differences in patient baseline characteristics , healthcare , and post - progression treatment across the different regions [ 14 ] , and highlight the importance of subgroup analyses according to regions . Here , we report results from a subgroup analysis of the JACOB trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in Japanese patients .",

Multicentre recruitment will allow more precise assessment of the intervention , with the aim of demonstrating that implementing RT in this setting is both feasible and safe among the centers .

SBRT is a technique of RT allowing delivery of a high equivalent biological dose in a highly conformed manner , with a favorable toxicity profile [ 3 ] , generally in a few fractions ( fx ) . The possibility of using special techniques such as SBRT in the palliative antalgic setting for bone metastases has been investigated in several phase 2 studies , with good results in terms of symptom response [ 12][13][14][15][16][17 ] . In order to better manage the toxicity profile of such hypofractioned regimens ( mainly related to risk of vertebral fracture [ 18 ] ) further studies [ 19,20 ] have suggested the possibility of using a hypofractionated regimen over the entire bone compartment and going to over - dose with a stereotactic regimen only for the macroscopically visible disease from instrumental examinations .

Single fraction ( 8Gy ) RT should be preferred for patients with inferior prognosis . Fractionated schedules are therefore often preferred for patients with better prognosis ( i.e. , > 6 months ) : the most widely adopted and supported by expert consensus is represented by 20Gy delivered in 5 fx of 4 Gy [ 23 ] . Routine use of prognostic scores to characterize life expectancy and define the most appropriate treatment regimen is very rarely applied in everyday clinical practice . Some randomized trials [ 8,12 ] are underway investigating the role of SBRT compared to conventional approaches for these patients , though not all of them through patient selection by validated prognostic scores . At the present time , a study by Guckenberger et al . ( NCT02800551 , DOSIS RCT , https:// clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02800551 ) is directly comparing a schedule administering 20 Gy in 5 fx to SBRT - SIB given with 5 or 10 fx ."

In 2018 , over 1,000,000 new cases were diagnosed with GC and approximately 783,000 deaths ( equating to 1 in 12 deaths worldwide ) . [ 1 ] Most patients ( > 70 % ) with GC are diagnosed at the advanced stage , [ 2 ] as a consequence , it shows a disappointing result . [ 3,4 ] Accumulating evidence shows that only 5 % of patients with metastatic cancer are still alive 5 years after diagnosis . [ 5 ] In recent years , immune microenvironment has been increasingly valued for its crucial role in the process of GC onset and progression . [ 6][7][8 ] Although surgical resection , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic therapeutic agents , and other measures have been used to improve the therapeutic efficacy of GC , [ 9 ] the prognosis is still dismal . [ 10 ] Thus , it is important to explore new strategies to prolong the survival , improve the quality of life of the advanced GC patients . Fortunately , traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) has its unique advantages in preventing and treating GC [ 11,12 ] and it also has an efficacy in improving immune function .

The three major subtypes of MZL defined by the World Health Organization ( WHO)-are splenic MZL , mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) MZL , and nodal MZL [ 3,4 ] , which are determined by the anatomical location of disease - initiating B - cells [ 5 ] . MALT is the most common MZL subtype , with an estimated 5-year overall survival ( OS ) and progression - free survival ( PFS ) > 90 % and 70 % while nodal MZL has been associated with most frequent relapse cases [ 2,[6][7][8 ] . Overall , MZL is characterized by an indolent clinical course [ 5 ] , yet remission is often followed by multiple relapses [ 9,10 ] , highlighting the need for tolerable maintenance treatments that can extend the remission periods induced by first - line therapies ."

Typically , patients suffer multiple relapses , and subsequent lines of therapy for MZL patients achieve progressively shorter responses [ 9 ] , therefore , extending the period of remission for MZL patients remains an essential goal . One potential strategy is the use of maintenance therapy once a response has been achieved with first - line therapy . Several NHL studies have previously evaluated rituximab as a maintenance agent [ 14,15,[28][29][30][31 ] . FL patients who receive rituximab - maintenance therapy after responding to first - line rituximab and chemotherapy experience significantly longer PFS compared to those receiving standard treatment [ 14,15 ] . Similar results were reported for the randomized phase III primary rituximab and maintenance ( PRIMA ) trial , in which 2 years of rituximab - maintenance therapy significantly improved the 6-year PFS in FL patients who responded to first - line rituximab and chemotherapy combination treatment , compared to patients on standard therapy [ R - CVP or R - CHOP ( rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisolone ) ] alone [ 28,29 ] ."

To achieve this goal , we analyzed data from a curated EHR - derived real - world dataset to compare outcomes in a cohort of women with hormone - receptor positive ( HR+ ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ( HER2- ) metastatic breast cancer ( mBC ) who received first - line letrozole therapy in a real - world setting with those in the control arm of the phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial .

Structured data such as diagnoses , lab values , and medication administrations were mapped to a common terminology and unstructured data ( eg , physician notes , lab / radiology reports ) underwent manual review [ 19 ] .

Although this is , to our knowledge , the first study of its kind in oncology , a similar analysis of data from a large health care database successfully mirrored the composite endpoints of the pivotal ONTARGET trial of the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan . [ 24 ] The analysis of data from more than 50,000 patients took approximately 12 weeks at a fraction of the cost of the pivotal trial . [ 24 ] Deriving endpoints in the oncology setting is admittedly a more labor - intensive task , requiring manual review of unstructured chart elements ( eg , clinician notes , radiology reports ) to arrive at high quality clinical outcome data . Enhancing the interoperability of EHRs and improving the capture of outcomes data are core goals of regulatory and private sector efforts to promote meaningful use of health information technology ( HIT ) . [ 25 ] Modifying EHRs to include structured fields that capture progression and response and training clinicians to enter relevant data into the correct fields may provide an easier path to capturing outcome measures in oncology clinical practice settings , and facilitate both retrospective and prospective studies of real - world outcomes . Such an effort would require the coordinated efforts of multiple stakeholders to provide the necessary HIT framework , education , and support to physicians and allied health professionals ."

The study was prompted by the phase 3 JGOG-3016 trial in which weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg / m\u00b2 ) in combination with 3-weekly carboplatin ( area under the curve[AUC]6 ) was found to confer improved progression - free survival and overall survival when compared with standard treatment in Japanese patients with advanced ovarian cancer . 1 As there is increasing evidence of pharma cogenomic distinctions between Asian and white populations , ICON8 was designed to explore whether the survival advantage observed in JGOG-3016 could also be observed in a mostly European population with ovarian cancer . 2,3 Results from ICON8 have shown that weekly , dose - dense paclitaxel - containing chemotherapy conferred no progression - free survival advantage when com pared with standard 3-weekly treatment . 4 As a secondary endpoint of the main study , the effect on health - related quality of life ( referred to as quality of life throughout this Article ) was assessed during treatment and in follow - up .

High - risk histologies included high - grade serous carcinoma , clear cell carcinoma , or other poorly differentiated and grade III subtypes . Other inclusion criteria were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status of 0 - 2 ; life expectancy longer than 12 weeks ; adequate haematological , renal , and hepatic function ; and able to start chemotherapy within 8 weeks after immediate primary debulking surgery . Patients were also eligible for the trial if there was no plan for surgery or planned delayed primary surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy .

Once a patient with metastatic CRC has experienced progression on first and second - line chemotherapy and biological therapies , the survival benefit of remaining therapies is limited [ 2,3 ] . In addition , therapeutic options may be constrained by patient comorbidities , age , or performance status . Novel therapeutic regimens are needed that are both tolerable and provide meaningful clinical benefit . Ziv - aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein containing portions of the extracellular domains of VEGFR1 ( also known as Flt-1 ) and VEGFR2 ( also known as KDR or Flk-1 ) . Ziv - aflibercept binds vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A , VEGF - B , and placental growth factor ( PlGF ) , thereby inhibiting VEGF - mediated angiogenesis [ 4 ] . Ziv - aflibercept is approved by the United Stated Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) for use in combination with Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , leucovorin , and irinotecan ( FOLFIRI ) for the second line treatment of metastatic CRC [ 5 ] . In the phase III VELOUR trial , the addition of ziv - aflibercept to FOLFIRI in patients with metastatic CRC resulted in a survival of 13.5 months , compared to 12.1 months for FOLFIRI alone ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.82 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.71 - 0.94 ; P < 0.01 ) [ 6 ] ."

In the chemotherapy refractory setting ( 3rd line and beyond ) , capecitabine monotherapy has a median time to progression of 2 months [ 13 ] . Prior studies combining capecitabine with the anti - VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab have shown that the combination is clinically active and tolerable , even among patients with advanced age or comorbidities [ 14,15 ] . Since anti - VEGF therapies are active for patients with metastatic CRC in the first - line [ 16 ] , second - line [ 17,18 ] , and beyond [ 2 ] , we hypothesized that the combination of capecitabine and ziv - aflibercept would be tolerable , and would exceed the PFS of historical controls ."

During that time , the Intermediate Clinical Endpoints in Cancer of the Prostate surrogacy work showed that measures based on metastatic progression could be used as a surrogate for survival in patients presenting with M0 disease , allowing trials in that setting to achieve increased power sooner [ 2 ] . Given the prognosis for metastatic and non - metastatic patients is now very different and that other trials of first - line docetaxel have kept metastatic and non - metastatic patients separate , the STAMPEDE team agreed that the long - term follow - up results would be analysed separately for these two groups of patients ."

However there is still controversy about patient stratification and selection for treatment . Metastatic burden sub - group analyses of the CHAARTED and GETUG-15 trials have led some to conclude that docetaxel should not be given as a first - line treatment of patients presenting with ' low metastatic burden ' disease [ 3,[9][10][11 ] . This represents $ 40 % of patients presenting with de novo mHNPC [ 12,13 ] . These were retrospective analyses of relatively small subgroups of these trials and a number of groups have not been persuaded by these exploratory retrospective analyses . Reflecting this uncertainty , major treatment guidelines offer conflicting advice about whether all metastatic patients should receive combination treatment or whether this should be restricted only to those with ' high - burden ' , as specified in the CHAARTED trial [ 11,[14][15][16 ] ."

Thus , development of alternative myeloma drugs for the refractory setting in particular is an urgent priority . Repurposing of well - known drugs approved for use in other therapeutic settings can potentially provide a shortcut to the development of new myeloma treatments 4 . The best example of this strategy is the success of thalidomide , which now shapes an entire class of myeloma agents , after originally being developed as a hypnotic agent ."

It has single - agent activity against myeloma in vivo , inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells via multiple pathways , including inhibition of proteasomal degradation and the PI3K / Akt pathway [ 5][6][7 ] and importantly , by inducing endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress . In a phase I trial ( SAKK 65/08 ) 8 we showed that nelfinavir inhibited proteasome activity and significantly upregulated the expression of proteins related to the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PMBC ) . This key modulator of protein production , folding and destruction 9,10 , also determines proteasome inhibitor sensitivity . Combination of nelfinavir with bortezomib further induced the UPR and overcame proteasome inhibitor resistance 8 . A subsequent phase II trial ( SAKK 39/13 ) demonstrated promising clinical activity of a nelfinavir - bortezomib - dexamethasone combination , with an unprecedented overall response rate of 65 % in heavily pretreated , proteasome inhibitor - refractory MM patients 11 . Preclinical data indicate that nelfinavir was able to overcome resistance to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib via modulation of multidrug resistance ( MDR ) efflux pumps such as ABCB1 ( ref . 12 ) . As lenalidomide is a substrate of the same pump family 12 , and via binding to the E3 ligase cereblon , works on the ubiquitin - proteasome system , we postulated that nelfinavir might likewise be able to overcome resistance to immunomodulatory drugs ."

In the USA , around 3300 - 6000 new cases of GIST are diagnosed each year [ 4 ] . The vast majority of cases are sporadic , and older age is a recognized risk factor .

Constitutive activation of either of these TKs plays a central role in the oncogenic behavior of GIST [ 6,7 ] . The early characterization of GIST mutational status is important in both the localized and metastatic settings to identify mutations which are primarily resistant to imatinib ( such as PDGFRA D842V ) , or exon 9 mutation which requires a higher dose of imatinib in the advanced setting [ 8,9 ] . Patients with GIST lacking KIT or PDGFRA mutations typically do not experience objective responses to imatinib . However , other mutations may be present in these tumors , with the largest group represented by succinate dehydrogenase - deficient GIST by immunochemistry , which may reflect underlying alterations in an succinate dehydrogenase subunit , and may be associated with familial heritable syndromes ( Carney triad or Carney - Stratakis syndrome ) [ 10][11][12][13][14 ] . Other subtypes of GIST lacking activating mutations in KIT or PDGFRA may have mutations in NF1 ( usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 ) or in BRAF or KRAS [ 15][16][17 ] . Very recently , cases of GIST - like tumors harboring NTRK translocations have further expanded the spectrum of molecular subtypes [ 18 ] ."

However , a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and driving role of the protooncogenes KIT and PDGFRA has transformed the treatment of both localized and metastatic diseases [ 9 ] . Localized , resectable tumors are treated surgically which remains the mainstay of curative therapy for localized disease . Resected high - risk GIST is typically treated with adjuvant imatinib following surgery , whereas low - risk GIST is managed with surgery alone . Intermediate - risk GIST is managed on a per - case basis [ 2,21,22 ] . In the advanced / metastatic setting , imatinib 400 mg daily is approved , with dose escalation to 800 mg at the time of progression , and has been shown to yield dramatic results in disease control [ 23][24][25 ] .

The KIT receptor is composed of an extracellular domain , a transmembrane hinge , a juxtamembrane ( JM ) domain that serves as an inhibitory switch , and a cytoplasmic region with a TK domain comprising a TK1 domain and a TK2 domain separated by a kinase insert domain ( Figure 1 ) [ 28 ] . ATP is anchored in the TK1 domain , and phosphorylation of substrates occurs in the TK2 domain . An activation loop ( activating switch ) , which stabilizes KIT in the active or ' on ' state , is also located in the TK2 domain . When ligand , stem cell factor , binds to KIT , the kinase domain becomes activated and stimulates downstream pathways , including Ras / Raf / MAPK , PI3K / Akt / mTOR , and Src kinase pathways , resulting in cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis [ 28 ] .

These dual switches regulate kinase activity by binding to the kinase switch pocket . The switch pocket is an area in the kinase that is adjacent to the ATP pocket . This pocket determines if the kinase will be in the ' on ' or ' off ' state . If the inhibitory switch binds to the switch pocket , the kinase is in the off state and is inactive . If the activation loop switch binds to the switch pocket , the kinase is in the on state and is active ( Figure 2 ) [ 29 ] . Oncogenic kinase mutations predominantly lead to disruption of one or more regulatory switch mechanisms , leading to dysregulated switch function and loss of normal , physiologic conformational control [ 30 ] ."

Secondary resistance mutations usually arise in the catalytic domain of the kinase : at the switch pocket , which typically occur in KIT exons 13 and 14 or PDGFRA exons 14 and 15 and sterically disrupt drug binding or conformationally activate KIT and in the activation loop switch encoded by KIT exons 17 and 18 and PDGFRA exon 18 [ 29,44,45 ] . Activation loop mutations act by shifting the kinase into an activated Type I or on - state conformation that is less amenable to drug binding by any of the approved Type II TKIs [ 46 ] . Although uncommon in primary GIST ( 1 - 2 % of newly diagnosed cases ) , mutations in exons 13 , 14 and 17 are often responsible for acquired imatinib resistance [ 38 ] , with exon 17 mutations alone accounting for as many as 50 % of the acquired resistance cases to imatinib ; exon 17 mutations also result in resistance to sunitinib [ 38,47 ] .

Although more than 80 % of patients with GIST receive clinical benefit from imatinib monotherapy , development of imatinib resistance is common , with more than half developing progressive disease in approximately 2 years [ 25,50,51 ] . Progression is largely due to secondary mutations in the KIT kinase domain that cause resistance to imatinib [ 45 ] . Although imatinib is effective against exon 11 mutations in KIT , and effective against exon 9 mutations when the dose is increased to 800 mg , little to no response to imatinib is seen for other primary or secondary KIT mutations and PDGFRA exon 18 D842V mutations , particularly those that mediate the conformational dynamics of the activation loop switch [ 2,50 ] ."

Ripretinib inhibits primary and secondary mutations on relevant exons that drive resistance to approved targeted therapies by regulating the kinase switch pocket and activation loop ; inhibition of activation loop mutations has previously only been targeted by Type I ( binds to the kinase ATP pocket in the active conformation ) inhibitors [ 29,49 ] . This profile is achieved through a unique dual mechanism of action that secures the kinase into an inactive conformation or off state , resulting in the inhibition of downstream signaling . Ripretinib acts as a structural surrogate for the inhibitory switch by binding to the switch pocket .

In metastatic patients , radiotherapy is frequently administered for several reasons , for instance to ease tumor pain , to increase bone stability or to mitigate localized disease symptoms and conditions from mass effects to tumor infiltrations such as bleeding , ulceration or organ compressions [ 1 ] . Recently , immunotherapies have been introduced as new treatment modalities aiming for the disinhibition of the natural antitumoral immune response . Significant benefits translating into tremendously improved progression - free survival and overall survival rates have been described for patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma and melanoma and lately also for patients with squamous or non - squamous NSCLC [ 2][3][4][5 ] . Among the many potential molecular structures that may be targeted pharmacologically , treatments directed against the PD-1/ PD - L1 immune checkpoint have improved survival at the cost of only modest toxicity for NSCLC patients in both 1st - and 2nd - line treatment situations . However , response rates range around only 20 % in previously treated patients , and also frontline administration of PD-1 inhibitors results in no tumor response in approximately half of the treated patients [ 4,6,7 ] . In order to identify patients more likely to respond to PD-1 blockade the expression of PD - L1 on tumor cells has been introduced as a biomarker . The utility of PD - L1 as a predictive biomarker , however , is still under debate , and alternatives such as tumor mutation burden ( TMB ) are now taken into account [ 7][8][9 ] ."

Specifically , photon radiation to one metastatic site has been observed to elicit a response to non - irradiated tumor sitescommonly referred to as the abscopal effect , which was first described in 1953 [ 14 ] . Radiation is known to induce immunogenic cell death , which is a unique expression pattern of cell damage - derived proteins from both tumor and stromal cells that may activate the immune system and promote the recognition of tumor - associated/\u2212specific proteins elsewhere in the body [ 10,15,16 ] ."

Thus , the clinical observation of any abscopal effect with radiation alone has always been a rare finding . With the advent of agents that target PD-1 / PD - L1 and therefore disinhibit tumor - directed immune responses , the potential of inducing an abscopal effect through combined radio - immunotherapies has gained renewed attention . Interestingly , a secondary analysis of a clinical landmark trial has identified 98 patients , who had received photon radiotherapy prior to immunotherapy [ 19 ] . These patients showed significantly improved PFS and OSirrespective of the expression of PD - L1 . This finding hasonce again nourished the hope that the combination of pharmacological disinhibition of the immune system through medical immunotherapies and tumor - antigen - exposing photon radiation may be a beneficial combination . However , to date results from prospective clinical trials investigating this hypothesis in lung cancer patients are not available ."

It was required to define a modified ITT population including all ITT patients with a baseline HRQoL score available .

AR messenger ribonuleic acid ( mRNA ) expression was similar between both groups ( Fig . 4B ) . Furthermore , expression levels of the transcript variant AR - V7 were low and were similar between both groups ( Fig . 4C ) . AR immunohistochemistry was available in 22 patients . Strong , nuclear AR staining was present in tumors from all 6 nonresponder samples and in all 15 responder samples that were tested ( SI Appendix , Table S2 ) .

To clarify mechanisms that contribute to enzalutamide resistance , we conducted a single - arm enzalutamide clinical trial . Metastatic tissue biopsies were required prior to study entry so we could attempt to identify molecular features associated with de novo resistance . Transcriptional profiling identified specific gene sets - including those linked to reduced AR transcriptional activity and a stemness program - that were activated in nonresponders . Our results suggest that patients whose tumors harbor this program should be considered for clinical trials testing rational agents to overcome de novo enzalutamide resistance . activity in nonresponders vs. responders using this signature ( Wilcoxon rank sum test P = 0.06 ) ( SI Appendix , Fig .

VIPER analysis also demonstrated that enzalutamide nonresponders had lower AR activity ( Fig . 5B ) .

Low AR activity has been linked to stemness and lineage plasticity , or change in differentiation state , that are now recognized as a common cause of acquired resistance to AR - targeting therapies ( 21)(22)(23)(24)(25 ) . Importantly , all of the baseline tumors from our study were adenocarcinomas , and most prostate adenocarcinoma tumors express a luminal lineage program ( 22 ) . However , a basal lineage , neurogenic / stemness program is present in a subset of patients and is linked with prostate cancer aggressiveness ( 26,27 ) . Indeed , prior work demonstrated that localized prostate tumors with a basal lineage program are much less likely to respond to ADT vs. patients whose tumors harbor a luminal lineage program ( 22 ) . Therefore , we next sought to measure signatures of these lineages ( 26 ) and determine if they were differentially activated between nonresponders and responders . Our analysis demonstrates that a basal lineage , neurogenic / stemness program is activated in nonresponders to enzalutamide treatment , while a luminal lineage program is more activated in responders ( Fig . 5C ) , corroborating the prior work in prostate cancer examining the effect of basal lineage on promoting resistance to ADT ( 22 ) ."

We have previously performed several clinical trials of a 24-h continuous intravenous infusion of irinotecan , given biweekly , combined with oral FUs ( UFT and UFT plus leucovorin ) , in patients with mCRC and reported that these regimens are therapeutically useful and have low incidences of diarrhea and other adverse events [ 8,9 ] .

The severity and trajectory of AEs ( symptoms or side - effects ) of both treatment schedules will be reported , allowing comparison between clinician reported AEs ( CTCAE V5.0 ) and patient - reported AEs using PROMs [ 16 ] . The primary outcome measure will be the summary score for HR - QoL of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) QLQ - C30 . Secondary descriptive outcomes will include EQ-5D-5L \u2122 , physical symptoms of RCC ( measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index ( FKSI-19 ) ) and known side - effects of ipilimumab and nivolumab measured by selected items from EORTC Quality of Life Group item bank [ 17 ] . We propose to use the item bank approach to cover expected toxicity of the investigational treatments , as due to the rapid introduction of new targeted cancer treatments there are no existing validated instruments that will cover the full range of AEs and using well developed and validated items from the item bank is a viable rapid alternative . PRO measures will be collected at baseline , weeks 7 and 13 , then 12-weekly . The data collection will stop at disease progression or 61 weeks , whichever is earlier .",

In recent years , several researches have suggested that preoperative radiotherapy and preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy may improve the overall survival ( OS ) compared to surgery alone in patients with head and neck cancer [ 4][5][6 ] . The advantages of preoperative radiotherapy or preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer include down - staging , increased resectability rate , etc . Further evidence from several phase 2 studies have shown that preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy provides excellent treatment outcomes by leading to a pathological complete response rate ranging from 35 to 61 % and an increased 5-year OS rate of up to 70 - 81.5 % [ 5][6][7][8 ] ."

In this study , 222 eligible patients were randomly assigned to a preoperative radiotherapy group ( n = 118 ) or a preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ( n = 104 ) . The results revealed that preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy led to a significantly improved distant metastasis - free survival ( DMFS ) compared to preoperative radiotherapy alone . According to the protocol , non - responders ( defined by < 80 % reduction of the primary lesion after preoperative treatment ) , subsequently underwent resection of the primary lesion with or without neck dissection depending on the nodal status .

PPS was split into two sub - states : subsequent treatment ( PPS - ST ) and best supportive care ( PPS - BSC ) . The modelled population was based on the only available phase I / II trial for acalabrutinib and assumed representative for the UK relapsed CLL patient population [ 13 ] . The model was based on the NICE assessment of the manufacturer 's submission for ibrutinib , appraisal number TA429 [ 14 ] . Patients moved between health states in cycles of 28 days with a time horizon of 30 years ( effectively lifetime ) . Half - cycle corrections were applied . Costs and outcomes were both discounted by 3.5 % . The model was constructed according to International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good modelling practice , and method reporting follows the In preclinical research , acalabrutinib did not inhibit EGFR , TEC , ITK or other agents [ 7][8][9][10 ] . Like ibrutinib , acalabrutinib binds covalently to Cys481 in the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) binding pocket of BTK . It shows a rapid oral absorption with a short plasma half - life , theoretically leading to less toxicity [ 11,12 ] . Early clinical studies with acalabrutinib showed overall response rates of 95 % at median followup of 14.3 months and mostly grade 1 or 2 adverse events without dose - limiting toxicity [ 13 ] .",

Rituximab is given in six cycles of 4 weeks , with an initial dose of 375 mg / m 2 and subsequent doses of 500 mg / m 2 , according to the NICE guideline for CLL [ 20 ] . Idelalisib is administered until disease progression or death in a dose of 150 mg twice daily . A dose intensity of 94.8 % was applied for acalabrutinib , ibrutinib and idelalisib , in accordance with findings from the RESONATE trial [ 2,14 ] . In this study , acalabrutinib was assessed relative only to its primary comparator from the same class within the same indication ( ibrutinib ) , as this is expected to be the main competitor in practice . Ofatumumab , physician 's choice or other treatment regimens were not assessed in this study . [ 13 ] . PFS and OS individual patient data for ibrutinib was reconstructed from the reported Kaplan - Meier curves [ 21 ] .",

PPS - ST was implemented by plotting a Weibull curve from the PFS given in the Kaplan - Meier graph provided by Furman et al . [ 22 ] . The Weibull curve was chosen because NICE evaluated it as being the most suited curve for this treatment . In this multicentre , randomised , double - blind , placebo - controlled , phase III study , the efficacy of rituximab and idelalisib combination therapy was assessed in patients with relapsed CLL [ 22 ] . After 80 cycles ( 75 months ) , Weibull plotted survival was < 0.01 % and therefore assumed to be 0 . Because transition probabilities to the PPS state are not explicitly modelled in a partitioned survival model , entry into the PPS state each cycle was calculated by subtracting a specific background mortality from the proportion of patients leaving PFS . This background mortality was retrieved from the Life Expectancy Tables from the Office for National Statistics [ 23 ] . This method was also used in the ibrutinib submission ; however , the background mortality was considered fixed , whereas ours increased with increasing age .",

Activated PI3K / AKT signaling is also associated with Cowden 's syndrome that is caused by germline phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) mutations . PTEN expression is also decreased in many sporadic breast cancers . Breast cancers with increased levels of AKT phosphorylation / activation and cancers exhibiting a gene expression signature of PTEN loss show poor disease outcome [ 1 ] . Loss of PTEN activity and activation of PI3 K signaling are associated with resistance to endocrine therapy [ 2 ] and trastuzumab [ 3,4 ] . Most PTEN - low tumors and many of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PIK3CA ) mutant tumors activate AKT for oncogenic signaling .

The study used an adaptive two - stage design stratified according to the cohort . In stage I of the study , we observed a confirmed partial response in a patient with a breast cancer bearing a PIK3CA mutation . By our adaptive design , one objective response fulfilled stage I criteria for response , thus both PIK3CA / AKT and PTEN loss / mutation cohorts proceeded to accrue . If there were no further responses seen , based on the initial statistical plan , we would be expected to treat 20 evaluable patients on the PIK3CA/ AKT arm and 12 patients on the PTEN loss arm before clinical futility would be declared and trial terminated . However , after 27 patients were enrolled in the study , no additional objective responses were seen , and the median PFS was 8 weeks . Therefore , the clinical team , after consulting with the trial statistician , made a decision to stop accrual due to a lack of clinical benefit . Figure 1 shows the swimmer plots for 27 patients . Eighteen patients were enrolled in the PIK3CA / AKT cohort . Of 14 patients with PIK3CA mutations , one patient had a partial response ( described below ) . Two patients came off the study due to toxicity and did not have an objective response assessment . One patient with both a PIK3CA mutation and PTEN loss was assigned to the PIK3CA / AKT arm and did not respond to treatment .

This may , in part , be due to inadequate target inhibition at tolerable doses in heavily pre - treated patients with pathway activation , as well as tumor heterogeneity and evolution in markers such as PTEN conferring challenges in patient selection . The lack of statistically significant pathway inhibition in the tumors was an interesting finding that needs further study , and raises awareness that circulating biomarkers may not adequately reflect target inhibition in tumor tissue . The fact that one of the patients with a PR had an activating KRAS mutation , also confirmed on pre - treatment biopsy , is unexpected , and suggests that the simplistic view that MAPK co - mutations would confer resistance to AKT inhibitors may not be sufficient for precision oncology , and better modeling of driver mutations , pathway activation , and adaptive responses is needed .",

This leaves the treating physician with a plethora of information that is difficult to consolidate intending counseling patients and drawing a clinical conclusion . Metascoring appears as an appropriate strategy [ 18,31,60,61 ] to overcome this , and we show that this is likewise possible in a randomized clinical trial setting . Regarding the molecular techniques used in the metascore , i.e. , iFISH and GEP , we choose to include both due to in part non - overlapping prognostic information , e.g. , it is not possible to predict del17p13 at a high - enough accuracy by GEP [ 62 ] . The actual ( good ) prediction result of our metascore per se is thereby not the main focus of our analysis . Nonetheless , even with this \" 2010 choice \" regarding risk factors and target genes , metascoring including GEPbased risk assessment is superior in numbers to rISS , although not statistically so .

Therefore , we validate that a trial strategy using either of the methods is possible , including reporting of potentially actionable targets . Risk assessment using our HM metascore allows to stratify patients with excellent / intermediate / adverse PFS and OS with survival rates of 98 % vs. 68 % vs. 25 % , respectively , after 5 years . In comparison to the rates by rISS of 86 % vs. 65 % vs. 40 % , respectively , both groups with better as well as more adverse survival are delineated by the HM metascore .",

The three randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating lenalidomide maintenance were included in a meta - analysis [ 5 ] which demonstrated a significant PFS and OS benefit with lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT when compared with placebo or observation . The optimal duration of lenalidomide maintenance is a matter of debate . In Cancer and Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) [ 3 ] and Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome ( IFM ) [ 2 ] trials , patients received post - ASCT placebo or continuous lenalidomide 10 mg for 3 months escalated then to 15 mg , until disease progression , intolerable side effects , or death . The IFM group decided to stop the treatment in the lenalidomide arm due to the noticed risk of secondary primary malignancies ( SPMs ) in opposite to the CALGB trial where patients continued maintenance until progression . Based on the meta - analysis , the risk of death due to SPM was similar between lenalidomide and placebo or observation groups but there was a 34 % reduction in risk to die of multiple myeloma ( MM ) in lenalidomide maintenance arm [ 5 ] ."

These targeted therapies have shown clinical activity and prolonged survival in patients with mRCC [ 6 ] ; however , responses are generally short - lived , development of treatment resistance is common [ 5,7 ] , and different classes of targeted therapy are associated with characteristic toxicity profiles that have implications for patient treatment selection [ 5 ] ."

Moreover , increased PD-1 / L1 expression in RCC is associated with aggressive pathological features and a worse prognosis [ 10][11][12 ] . In patients with mRCC , anti - PD-1 and anti - PD - L1 antibodies have shown promising responses and improved overall survival ( OS ) , both as monotherapy and in combination with other classes of agents . Nivolumab ( anti - PD-1 ) was the first agent in this class to be approved by regulatory authorities , based on findings from the randomized phase III CheckMate 025 trial , which compared nivolumab monotherapy with everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who had received prior antiangiogenic therapy [ 13 ] . More recently , nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab ( anti - cytotoxic T - lymphocyte protein 4 ) was approved for patients with previously untreated , intermediate - or poor - risk , advanced RCC , based on OS data from the phase III CheckMate 214 trial of nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared with sunitinib [ 14 ] ."

LMP1 and LMP2 in particular behave like B cell receptor ( BCR)mediated Akt , which is dependent upon spleen tyrosine kinase and Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) . These tyrosine kinases contribute to enhanced cellular proliferation and survival signaling such as the nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - \u03baB ) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K / Akt ) pathways [ 6 ] . In our experiment , we transfected vector - encoding LMP1 or LMP1_delCTAR1(C - terminal - activating region 1 ) and LMP1_delCTAR2 into a DLBCL cell line and observed the BCR signaling pathway ( Supplementary Materials and methods ) . As a result , the BTK signaling pathway was activated when LMP1 was expressed . It was also confirmed that the CTAR1 of LMP1 was an important domain for BTK activation . In addition , cell viability was decreased when the BTK inhibitor ( ibrutinib ) was treated with LMP1-expressing cells ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Based on previous studies that proved the efficacy of rituximab - cyclophosphamidedoxorubicin hydrochloride - vincristine sulfate - prednisone ( RCHOP ) therapy combined with ibrutinib ( I - RCHOP ) , we designed this study to boost the anti - tumor effect of EBVpositive DLBCL [ 7,8 ] . Here , we report the results of an open - label , multicenter phase II study that investigated the combination ibrutinib and RCHOP for EBV - positive DLBCL using a matched case - control study .",

Patients often present with advanced disease with worldwide 5-year survival rates of 9 % , reducing to 3 % for metastatic pancreatic cancer [ 2 ] . Median progression - free survival ( PFS ) with standard - of - care first - line treatments is around 6 months and disease progression can result in deterioration in health - related quality of life ( HRQoL ) [ 3,4 ] . As a consequence , patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer have reduced HRQoL due to high emotional burden , symptom burden ( in particular pain , fatigue , vomiting and diarrhoea ) , and poor prognosis [ 5][6][7][8][9][10 ] . When evaluating the best treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer , it is important to not only assess survival , which is relatively short , but also ensure that there are no detrimental effects of treatment on HRQoL. Indeed , American Society for Clinical Oncology guidelines on treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer recommend that clinicians should proactively discuss quality of life issues such as pain , fatigue , and loss of appetite , which tend to be overlooked yet have significant impact on daily life , with their patients [ 11 ] ."

The aim of maintenance treatment is to prolong PFS , and ultimately overall survival , delaying the need for subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy . In addition , maintenance treatment should seek to preserve HRQoL , which may be improved following effective first - line chemotherapy [ 13 ] . First - line treatment with FOLFIRINOX has been shown to improve overall HRQoL and lead to a decrease in some symptoms , including pain , for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer [ 13 ] . A prespecified secondary objective of the POLO trial was to evaluate the effect of olaparib on HRQoL , specifically the adjusted mean change from baseline in Global Health Status ( GHS ) score using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-item module ( EORTC QLQ - C30 ) ."

Furthermore , mutations in RAS or BRAF have been suggested as predictive biomarkers for MEK inhibition . 8,9 In previous clinical trials , selumetinib , an inhibitor of MEK1/ 2 , demonstrated interesting activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with metastatic BTC . 10,11 Similarly , binimetinib is a potent , adenosine triphosphate - uncompetitive , highly selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/2 with on - target activity that has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo . 12 Moreover , phase I study of binimetinib showed a manageable safety profile , target inhibition and dose - proportional exposure . 13 In this study , we evaluated the preclinical synergistic activity of binimetinib and fluoropyrimidine against BTC cell lines . Supported by the preclinical results , we then conducted a phase Ib study of binimetinib and capecitabine in gemcitabinepretreated BTC patients to assess the safety and early antitumor activity .

When the BTC cells were treated with both binimetinib and 5-FU , the TS levels induced by 5-FU were partially downregulated by addition of binimetinib , which may increase the sensitivity of 5-FU .

Patients with Vp3 / Vp4 invasion ( invading the firstorder branches and/or main trunk of the portal vein ) , an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status of 0 to 2 and a Child - Pugh ( CP ) class of A or B were eligible . Any prior interventions were allowed , except for previous RT . Those patients were considered unsuitable for standard locoregional treatment via multidisciplinary committee discussion . Given increasing evidence of the benefits of SABR for HCC patients in the past decades , our hospital practice naturally shifted from use of CFRT to use of SABR . Because SABR was not reimbursed until 2015 in Taiwan , the choice of RT technique was determined partly by the patients ' financial resources .",

A contrast CT scan with a 1 mm slice thickness was obtained for treatment planning with or without MRI scan registration . The definition of CTV in SABR was the same as in the CFRT technique . The PTV was defined as the volume with a margin of 0 - 3 mm added to CTV for patients with fiducial implantation . If fiducial implantation failed or was unsuitable , the PTV margin was expanded to 8 - 20 mm craniocaudally , based on the liver motion . Margin modification was permitted for respecting normal tissue tolerance .

No survival difference was noted between patients treated before December 31 , 2011 versus after December 31 , 2011 . Given the presence of the high correlation between BED and the RT Fig . 3 Overall survival ( a ) and in - field progression - free survival ( b ) in the entire cohort using Kaplan Meier method technique ( p < 0.001 ) , these variables were analyzed by two different Cox models to avoid collinearity . The presence of SABR and BED \u226565 Gy correlated significantly with superior OS in separate multivariable analysis models ( Table 3 ) .

VEGF targeting antibodies alleviate age - related macular degeneration , but in cancer therapy , they provide only limited benefits . For this reason , a significant interest has emerged in the targeting of the more recently characterized Ang / Tie endothelial growth factor system , which has essential functions in embryonic development , the regeneration of the mature vasculature , tissue inflammation and tumor angiogenesis [ 2][3][4][5][6 ] . Angiopoietin growth factors ( Ang1 - 4 ) bind to the Tie2 receptor .

In normal homeostasis , Ang2 levels are low , but the Ang2 / Ang1 ratio is increased in inflamed tissues , e.g. in sepsis and in malignancies , including breast cancer [ 12,13 ] . High Ang2 levels are associated with poor patient survival in multiple malignancies , breast cancer among others [ 14][15][16][17][18][19 ] . Some of the Ang / Tie system targeted antibodies have already been evaluated in clinical trials , but so far , the effects of anti - Ang2 monotherapy have been modest [ 20][21][22 ] . A better understanding of Ang function is clearly needed for the rational development of effective Ang - pathway targeted therapies . Although Tie1 expression in endothelial cells is increased in tumor vessels and deletion of the Tie1 gene in tumor - bearing mice decreased tumor growth and angiogenesis in preclinical experiments [ 4,23 ] , the significance of Tie1 in tumor progression is also unclear . Tie1 ectodomain cleavage occurs in vivo in association with acute [ 11 ] and chronic inflammation [ 24 ] , leading to increased concentration of the soluble extracellular domain in the serum of patients with severe viral infections [ 11 ] . Furthermore , Tie1 deletion in a murine metastasis model tightened endothelial barrier and therefore , reduced metastatic foci [ 25 ] ."

RESONATE-2 is an international phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of first - line ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil in older patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) [ 8 ] . The primary analysis ( median follow - up of 18.4 months ) demonstrated an 84 % reduction in the risk of disease progression ( PD ) or death ( as assessed by an independent review committee ) and significant improvement in OS for ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil , supporting the initial approval of first - line ibrutinib for CLL / SLL in the United States and for CLL in the European Union , with ibrutinib now approved for CLL in over 90 countries [ 8][9][10 ] . Data previously reported from this study after a median follow - up of 28.5 months demonstrated a sustained PFS benefit for ibrutinib and improved depth of response over time , with no new unexpected safety concerns [ 11 ] .

Serous - type is the most common subtype among EOCs in general ; however , endometriosis - associated EOCs , such as clear cell type or endometrioid type are relatively common in certain populations , including Taiwan and Japan [ 7][8][9][10][11 ] . Clinically , the serous - type EOC and primary peritoneal serous carcinoma ( PPSC ) and primary Fallopian tube cancer ( PFTC ) are often considered the same group disease , based on the similar clinical behavior and possibly sharing the similar pathogenesis [ 12][13][14][15][16][17][18 ] . In 1996 , McGuire and colleagues conducted a clinical trial to set up the standard therapy for patients with ETOC , including primary debulking surgery ( PDS ) , also called primary cytoreductive surgery ( PCS ) plus adjuvant triweekly paclitaxel and cisplatin therapy [ 19 ] . The following studies have confirmed the superiority of survival benefits using paclitaxel into cisplatin - based regimens in place of cyclophosphamide for the treatment of patients with ETOC and PPSC [ 20,21 ] . Additionally , carboplatin in place of cisplatin in this combination has statistically significantly reduced the cisplatin - related potential toxicity of neural and renal systems and ameliorated the cisplatin - related high emetic effects [ 22][23][24][25 ] ."

In addition , dose - dense chemotherapy can not only preserve the immune system but also promote the treatment - mediated tumor - specific immunity , especially the antitumor kill cluster of differentiation 8 + ( CD8 + ) T - cell response [ 103 ] . Therefore , hematological markers have been evaluated to try to establish their predictive value [ 104][105][106][107 ] . Dose intensity strategies include increasing the dose per cycle , decreasing the cycle interval ( dose densification ) and decreasing the interval plus increasing the dose [ 108 ] . However , the latter two strategies involved shortening the gap between chemotherapy , which has proven decisive in some neoplasms such as breast cancer [ 99 ] , and , of most importance , this more frequent administration of cytotoxic agents within short intervals has also decreased the chemotherapy - related death associated with the use of massive doses , such as infection or sepsis caused by severe neutropenia or spontaneous hemorrhage caused by severe thrombocytopenia [ 49 ] ."

In the next year ( 2004 ) , the same author found that increasing the dose of cisplatin above a certain threshold is not recommended in EOC patients because the greater toxicity with higher dose of cisplatin was found [ 110 ] , although some studies did not support a significant increase toxicity after weekly dose - dense cisplatin treatment ( median dose intensity with 32 or 45 mg / m 2 /week ) [ 108 ] . However , the therapeutic effect of dose - dense platinum is still controversial . Some are in favor [ 111,112 ] , but many are against the resultant benefits of dose - dense platinum [ 108,[113][114][115][116 ] . Biweekly dose - dense carboplatin ( AUC5 ) combined with paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m 2 ) is not feasible based on dose - limiting toxicity , even though GCSF was used for support [ 116 ] . Previous studies that the main determinant of dose - dense treatment response was not achieved by the relative dose intensity of platinum itself [ 108 ] . Indeed , one report showed that the administration of dose up to cisplatin of 25 mg / m 2 /week might reach the plateau of dose - response curve [ 113 ] ."

In theory , weekly dose - dense paclitaxel provided the better cytotoxicity to tumors , through more sustained exposure , limiting the emergence of tumors resistant to chemotherapy , enhancing the apoptotic and antiangiogenic effect , and improving the therapeutic index [ 94,[118][119][120 ] , although the single use of dose - dense paclitaxel for the first - line chemotherapy treatment of patients with ETOC seemed to be not approved by clinical trials [ 109,110 ] ."

In the management of all chemosensitive epithelial cancers , combination chemotherapy treatment has provided significant survival benefits compared to single agent chemotherapy when applied as initial therapy , and there is no doubt that the treatment of ETOC is similar in this regard [ 121 ] . Studies showed that combination of taxane and platinum compound appears both to attenuate the toxicity of the platinum compound and to facilitate the delivery of full dose on schedule and this full dose on schedule showed the strong correlation with patient outcomes [ 110 ] . Since both platinum and paclitaxel are the essential cytotoxic agents in ETOC patients after PCS , either any one or both can be administered as dose - dense protocol . Furthermore , dose - dense can be classified according to the types , including semiweekly dose - dense , in which paclitaxel was given weekly and carboplatin was given triweekly , and weekly dose dense , in which both paclitaxel and carboplatin were given weekly [ 47 ] . An accumulation dose of paclitaxel is 240 - 270 mg / m 2 with separating into 80 - 90 mg / m 2 per week compared to a single use of 175 - 180 mg / m 2 every three weeks .

The median OS was 58.5 months in the paclitaxel - cisplatin group and 55.0 months in the paclitaxel - carboplatin group . Although neither PFS nor OS reached the statistically significant difference , it seemed to be little better in patients treated with the paclitaxel - cisplatin regimen compared to those treated with the paclitaxel - carboplatin regimen . However , to compare the frequency and severity of AEs , we found that patients in the paclitaxel - carboplatin group had more AEs than those in paclitaxel - cisplatin group did , including a higher risk of neutropenia and grade 3/4 neutropenia , and the need for a longer period to complete the front - line chemotherapy . The need for a longer period to finish the dose - dense therapy seemed to be associated with a worse outcome for patients . Further analysis showed that the period between the first - time chemotherapy to the last dose ( 6 cycles ) of chemotherapy > 21 weeks was associated with worse prognosis in patients compared to that \u226421 weeks , with hazard ratio ( HR ) of 81.24 for PFS and 9.57 for OS . As predicted , suboptimal debulking surgery ( > 1 cm ) also contributed to the worse outcome than optimal debulking surgery ( \u22641 cm ) with a HR of 14.38 for PFS and 11.83 for OS ( Tables 3 and 4 ) .",

Although thrombocytopenia unlikely occurs in chemotherapy - na\u00efve patients , this toxicity usually begins to appear after day 14 and is predictably cumulative , contributing to the consideration of a carboplatin dose reduction [ 140 ] . Due to aforementioned limitation , some gynecological oncologists favored the use of cisplatin as the drug in the platinum - based combination therapy , except for those patients with identified impaired renal function ( eGFR < 60 ml / min ) . The current low - dose cisplatin plus dose - dense paclitaxel regimen was associated with lower rates of hematologic toxicities compared to the conventional dose - dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen . The results from an ICON8 have also shown that patients treated with a weekly regimen had increased grade 3 or 4 toxic effects , although these high - grade toxicities were predominantly uncomplicated [ 33 ] .

We believe that this carboplatin - paclitaxel combination therapy - related hematotoxicity might explain why more patients in the carboplatin - paclitaxel arm had a prolongation of the period between the initial first dose of chemotherapy and the final dose of chemotherapy ( six cycles of chemotherapy ) than those in the cisplatin - paclitaxel arm ( 45 % versus 11.1 % , p = 0.018 ) .

One study showed an interesting finding that patients still had diverse outcomes despite undergoing optimal PCS ( \u2264 1 cm residual disease ) , in which it demonstrated that patients with a tumor limited in a single anatomic location had better median PFS and OS than patients with tumors widely distributed in multiple anatomic locations [ 146 ] .",

Patients received either 20 \u00d7 2 Gy or 12 \u00d7 2 Gy involved field RT ( IF - RT ) without revealing any difference in the local or systemic control . Despite several critical issues in the study design ( e.g. , heterogeneous histology with 40 % non - follicular grade 1/2 , previous treatments , and non - standardized follow - up examinations ) , 24 Gy was then recommended as a standard dose by the European Society for Medical Oncology [ 2 ] ."

Subsequently , more patients with lowgrade lymphoma received the 2 \u00d7 2 Gy scheme : Table 1 [ 3 - 8 ] shows a summary of different trials using 2 \u00d7 2 Gy LDRT , and CR rates range from 37 % to 82 % . In a subset of patients ( low tumor burden , fewer previous chemotherapies , age of less than 65 years , and treatment with curative intent ) , LDRT showed excellent results ; ORR and CR rate ranged from 93 % to 81 % and from 57 % to 90 % , respectively [ 5,6,8 ] . The mode of action of 2 \u00d7 2 Gy is not completely understood . An induction of the p53 pathway is discussed [ 9,10 ] .

However , this trial has several major weaknesses ( e.g. , no limitation or stratification of lymphoma size ; no differentiation between FL grade 1 , 2 , 3a , or 3b ; no central pathological review ; and no standardized follow - up with three - dimensional imaging ) [ 12 ] . In summary , the FORT trial showed some efficacy after LDRT , but in light of the mentioned issues , it is not clear whether the difference between LDRT and 24 Gy was as large as published .

However , owing to slow accrual of patients , the independent data monitoring committee approved a reduction of the sample size in January 2015 to 120 patients in both arms ; this would enable the observation of 84 PFS events , which would indicate a superior treatment with a probability of 70 % .",
